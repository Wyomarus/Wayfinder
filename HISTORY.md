# Wayfinder History

## Summary
Explain the scope and purpose of this project and define goals and non-goals.

## Scope and purpose
Having played World of Warcraft since Vanilla with friends and family, and after nearly twenty years, I realized that I had not even looked into writing an add-on for this game. As a programmer by trade, this piqued my curiosity. I had never written anything in Lua before, but that had never stopped me from learning a new language before.

## Goals

### Simple and lightweight
- Reasonable defaults
- Minimal configuration
- Optimize for processing and memory, but not at the expense of readability and maintainability

### Focus on the entire add-on development and management process

- Write clean code that is readable and maintainable
- Be idiomatic. Leverage the features of and write in the style of the language
- VS Code
  - sumneko.lua
  - Ketho.wow-api
  - Septh.wow-bundle
